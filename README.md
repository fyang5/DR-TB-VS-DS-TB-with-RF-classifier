# Classification DRvsDS _using  a RF model
load the test data and training data first, then using a random forest (RF) classifier to perform classification. 
testData.mat is the test data with 7 demographic features and 20 radiological features.
trainData.mat is the train data with 7 demographic features and 20 radiological features. 
run testmain.m , you will get the performance such as AUC, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, etc.

# Classification DRvsDS_using a SVM model
load the test data and training data first, then using SVM classifier to perform classification.
testData.mat is the test data with 25 clincial and radiological features.
trainData.mat is the train data with 25 clinical and radiological features.
run testmain.m , you will get the performance such as AUC, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, etc.
